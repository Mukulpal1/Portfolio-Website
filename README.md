# Portfolio Website README


Welcome to my portfolio website repository! This repository contains the code and resources for my personal portfolio website. Below you will find information about the structure of the project and how to set it up locally.

## Project Structure
The project is structured as follows:

**index.html:** This is the main HTML file that serves as the entry point to the website.

**css/:** This directory contains all CSS files used for styling the website.

**js/:** This directory contains any JavaScript files used for interactivity.

**images/:** All images used across the website are stored here.

**fonts/**: If any custom fonts are used, they will be stored in this directory.
